                    She's got a smile that it seems to me
                    <br>
                    Reminds me of childhood memories
                    <br>
                    Where everything was as fresh as the bright blue sky
                    <br>
                    Now and then when I see her face
                    <br>
                    She takes me away to that special place
                    <br>
                    And if I stare too long, I'd probably break down and cry
                </p>
                <p>
                    Whoa, oh, oh
                    <br>
                    Sweet child o' mine
                    <br>
                    Whoa, oh, oh, oh
                    <br>
                    Sweet love of mine
                </p>
                <p>
                    She's got eyes of the bluest skies
                    <br>
                    As if they thought of rain
                    <br>
                    I'd hate to look into those eyes and see an ounce of pain
                    <br>
                    Her hair reminds me of a warm safe place
                    <br>
                    Where as a child I'd hide
                    <br>
                    And pray for the thunder and the rain to quietly pass me by
                </p>
                <p>
                    Whoa, oh, oh
                    <br>
                    Sweet child o' mine
                    <br>
                    Whoa whoa, oh, oh, oh
                    <br>
                    Sweet love of mine
                </p>
                <p>
                    Whoa, yeah
