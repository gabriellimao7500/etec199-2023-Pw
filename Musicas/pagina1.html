                    Leading on your death's construction
                </p>

                    Master of puppets, I'm pulling your strings
                    <br>
                    Twisting your mind and smashing your dreams
                    <br>
                    Blinded by me, you can't see a thing

                    Needlework the way, never you betray
                    <br>
                    Life of death becoming clearer
                    <br>
                    Pain monopoly, ritual misery

                <p>
                    Master, master, where's the dreams that I've been after?
                    <br>
                    Master, master, you promised only lies
                    <br>
                    Laughter, laughter, all I hear or see is laughter
                    <br>
                    Laughter, laughter, laughing at my cries
                    <br>

                    Hell is worth all that, natural habitat
                    <br>
                    Just a rhyme without a reason
                    <br>
                    Never-ending maze, drift on numbered days
                    <br>
                    Now your life is out of season
                </p>

                    I will run through you
                    <br>
                    Now I rule you too
