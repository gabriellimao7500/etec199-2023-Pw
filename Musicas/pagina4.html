            <h3>
                <p>
                    There's a lady who's sure
                    <br>
                    All that glitters is gold
                    <br>
                    And she's buying a stairway to heaven
                    <br>
                    When she gets there she knows
                    <br>
                    If the stores are all closed
                    <br>
                    With a word she can get what she came for
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
                    <br>
                    And she's buying a stairway to heaven
                    <br>
                    There's a sign on the wall
                    <br>
                    But she wants to be sure
                    <br>
                    'Cause you know, sometimes words have two meanings
                    <br>
                    In a tree by the brook
                    <br>
                    There's a songbird who sings
                    <br>
                    Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven
                </p>
                <p>Ooh, it makes me wonder</p>
                <p>Ooh, it makes me wonder</p>
                <p>
                    There's a feeling I get
                    <br>
                    When I look to the west
                    <br>
                    And my spirit is crying for leaving
                    <br>
                    In my thoughts I have seen
                    <br>
                    Rings of smoke through the trees
                    <br>
                    And the voices of those who stand looking
                    <br>
                </p>
                <p>Ooh, it makes me wonder</p>
                <p>Ooh, it makes me wonder</p>
                <p>
                    And it's whispered that soon
                    <br>
                    If we all call the tune
                    <br>
                    Then the piper will lead us to reason
                    <br>
                    And a new day will dawn
                    <br>
                    For those who stand long
                    <br>
                    And the forests will echo with laughter
                </p>
                <p>
                    Oh whoa-whoa-whoa, oh-oh
                </p>
                <p>
                    If there's a bustle in your hedgerow, don't be alarmed now
                    <br>
                    It's just a spring clean for the May Queen
                    <br>
                    Yes, there are two paths you can go by, but in the long run
                    <br>
                    And there's still time to change the road you're on
                </p>
                <p>And it makes me wonder</p>
                <p>Oh, whoa</p>
                <p>
                    Your head is humming and it won't go
                    <br>
                    In case you don't know
                    <br>
                    The piper's calling you to join him
                </p>
                <p>
                    Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow?
                    <br>
                    And did you know
                    <br>
                    Your stairway lies on the whispering wind?
                </p>
                <p>
                    And as we wind on down the road
                    <br>
                    Our shadows taller than our soul
                    <br>
                    There walks a lady we all know
                    <br>
                    Who shines white light and wants to show
                    <br>
                    How everything still turns to gold
                    <br>
                    And if you listen very hard
                    <br>
                    The tune will come to you at last
                    <br>
                    When all are one and one is all, yeah
                    <br>
                    To be a rock and not to roll
                </p>
                <p>And she's buying a stairway to heaven</p>
